# todo-backend-rust-iron

This is an implementation for the http://todobackend.com project written in rust as my first adventure in the rust world.

Run the tests with `cargo test` and the app with `cargo run` (you will want to edit the todo.rs file before you do that - check it out and you'll know why).

To run the integration tests check out https://github.com/TodoBackend/todo-backend-js-spec
